# Seeder
Automatically seed meteor collections with fake data using simple schema definition.
***Warning: *** It's a working in progress package and still does not support embedded schema so please feel free to submit pull request of bug reports for any issues you may come across.

### Install
To install, simply run the following command in the root of your meteor project - 
```
meteor add foysalit:seeder
```

### Usage
The seeder is only available on the server so make sure it is placed somewhere in the ***server/*** directory or check ```Meteor.isServer``` before running the seeder.

```
new Seeder({
	collection: <CollectionVar>, // Must be a valid Mongo.Collection instance
	total: <Number of Entries> // default to 1
});
```

When you define your collection schema with [simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema), you can set a property in the schema definition for a field named `seeder` which is a ```String``` which defines the faker generator with ***dot notation***. 
If you want a firstName generated by faker, you can define the seeder to be ```seeder: 'name.firstName'```. The package uses this definition to invoke the faker generator like this - ```faker.name.firstName()```.  

Below is a complete schema definition -

```
Items.attachSchema(new SimpleSchema({
	title: {
		type: String,
		max: 20,
		seeder: 'lorem.sentence'
	},
	color: {
		type: String,
		seeder: 'internet.color'
	},
	rating: {
		type: Number,
		max: 30
	},
	active: {
		type: Boolean,
		defaultValue: true
	},
	createdAt: {
		type: Date
	},
	updatedAt: {
		type: [Date]
	}
}));
```

In the above example, you'll notice that some fields ***do not*** have the seeder property and this still works because ***even if there is no seeder set, the package will try it's best to generate the data using the ```type``` property.*** (Please keep in mind that, for now the fallback support is very limited so it might not give you the expected dummy data).
